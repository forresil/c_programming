The Databank example creates a databank file "data1" in his directory.

Insert elements to this databank by typing: 
$./foo insert [idx] [name] [lastName] [age] by. ex: $./foo insert 5 Adam Smith 23 

Print the element on the screen by typing:
$./foo print [idx] by. ex: $./foo print 5

Delete an element of the databank by typing:
$./foo delete [idx] by ex.: $./foo delete 5

Take a look on the data stored in the databank file "data1" by typing:
$./oc -c data1
